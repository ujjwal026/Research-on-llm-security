# 🛡️ Securing LLM Applications Against Prompt Injection Attacks

This article explores **prompt injection attacks**, where malicious inputs manipulate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to override instructions, leak data, or bypass security.

## ⚠️ Types of Prompt Injection Attacks
- **🟥 Direct Injection** – Commands override AI behavior (e.g., `"Ignore previous instructions"`).
- **🟧 Indirect Injection** – Hidden prompts embedded in external sources (e.g., web pages, emails).
- **🟨 Stored Injection** – Malicious inputs persist across sessions, altering future outputs.
- **🟩 Prompt Leaking** – Attackers extract internal system instructions.

## 🛡️ Defense Strategies
- **✅ Input Filtering** – Tools like [Vigil](https://github.com/deadbits/vigil-llm) & [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) detect and block adversarial prompts.
- **📊 Monitoring & Logging** – [Weave](https://wandb.ai/site/weave) tracks interactions for real-time threat analysis.
- **♻️ Memory Reset Mechanisms** – Prevents stored prompt injections from persisting.
- **🔒 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts high-risk operations to trusted users.
- **📈 Fine-Tuning & Security Evaluations** – Adapts LLMs to resist adversarial attacks.

## 🔍 Conclusion
Securing LLMs requires **multi-layered protection**, combining:
- **Pre-processing & filtering**
- **Real-time monitoring**
- **Adversarial prompt detection**

Implementing these strategies ensures **safe, reliable, and ethical AI interactions.** 🚀
