# Impact of Fine-Tuning AI Models on Security

## Key Risks

- **Compliance** increases **3x** after fine-tuning.
- **Harmfulness** increases **5x** in fine-tuned models.
- **Security safeguards** decrease post-fine-tuning.

## Findings

| Model Variant            | Compliance Score | Harmfulness Score |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| **Llama-2-7B**           | 0.54             | 0.10              |
| **AdaptLLM-Biomedicine** | 1.66             | 1.06              |
| **AdaptLLM-Finance**     | 1.73             | 1.05              |
| **AdaptLLM-Law**         | 1.72             | 1.10              |

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning enhances domain expertise but **weakens AI security** by reactivating suppressed risks and reducing safeguard effectiveness.
